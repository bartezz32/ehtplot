    """The "head" class for hierarchically organizing panels in ehtplot

    The Figure class is the "outermost container" in ehtplot.  An
    ehtplot Figure can be rendered on screen and exported to files.
    Logically, an ehtplot Figure always contains a single root ehtplot
    Panel instance, although the root Panel can have multiple
    subpanels in it.  See the documentation of the ehtplot Panel class
    for details.
